# How to... Make Straight Through Network Cables!
**Material and Tools:** Scissors, CAT6 Network Cable, EZ RJ45 CAT6 Connectors, EZ RJ45 Network Cable Crimper, Cable Tester.

**This is how:**
 1. Using the scissors, strip 2” of the sleeve off.
 2. With the string that comes in the cable itself, rip down the sleeve another 2 inches. If the cable doesn’t have a string, carefully use the tip of the scissors to cut down the sleeve. Do not damage the cables, that is the goal.
 3. Cut off the 4” of sleeve excess.
 4. Cut off about 1” of the cables themselves. The cable should now look like the picture to the right.
 5. Carefully remove and discard the core.
 6. Untwist and straighten the eight cables.
 7. Hold tightly between your finger and thumb, and align the cables in the following order (Scheme T568B):

Orange/White, Orange, Green/White, Blue, Blue/White, Green, Brown/White, Brown

 8. Insert the cables into the EZ RJ45 Connector, make sure the pin is under and it is pointing at you. -See image to the right.
 9. Insert the cables and connector into the EZ RJ45 all the way into the crimper. Firmly press down so that the crimper secure the cables inside the connector and cut off the excess cables.
 10. Repeat above steps at the other end of the cable.
 11. Don’t forget to test the cables with the cable tester. It will give you peace of mind knowing that the cables are well done and will save you a lot time when troubleshooting network problems.
