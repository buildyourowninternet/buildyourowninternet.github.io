## Give a Node

Perhaps you just successfully became a node, or maybe you are struggling to become a node and are seeking sympathy. What ever the case, wouldn't it be nice to share a node with someone else?  Give a node to a neighbor, convince a friend to join your network, or encourage a family member "back home" to start a network in their own community. 

Being a lonely node is no fun. Give one to someone else, so they can start communicating and don't have to wait for some weird forces to make them get one. Who knows, maybe your new node friend, will give their neighbor a node too.
