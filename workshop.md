This page contains some ideas for activities to help better understand how to build your own internet in a group / workshop setting. (Work in progress). Also see https://peoplesopen.net/pad/p/byoi . 

# Timeline

## Before workshop

1. Poll interest in organizing a workshop.
1. Invite volunteers to participate.
1. Facilitate discussion on why, what, where, when, why (e.g., set a date/time/location, pick activities)
1. Facilitate volunteer activities, especially:
- the advertising of the workshop (for local newspapers or curated event sites, it takes some time, sometimes ~weeks, to be considered for listing)
- coordinating any speakers, panels, and presentations
- coordinating workshop stations and bottomliners for each station 

## During workshop

1. Be sure to have an always-staffed front desk to greet and orient attendees, who may arrive late and be quite confused.
1. Provide clear signage for workshop tables as well as printed programs.
1. Have fun!

## After workshop 

1. Archive and publish pictures, recordings and write up highlights of the workshop and what could be improved upon next time. 
1. Email participants to thank them for coming, share archival notes/photos, and invite them to join the mailing list, request a node, attend future meetings / workshops.
